	<h1>Guilds - Charters, Responsibilities and Job Roles</h1>
	<p>OSIsoft’s Engineering organization includes a variety of roles that provide support to our Software Development teams and help them achieve the goals of their programs.  While many of these roles are not responsible for the development or delivery of specific software products or services, they do provide critical guidance to the teams and in some cases additional deliverables that augment our products and services and increase their value to customers.  These supporting roles are organized into functionally aligned teams known as Engineering Guilds.  The charters and responsibilities of each of these guilds is documented here, along with a description of each role within the guilds.</p>
	<p>Each guild has expertise in some aspect of Software Development. The supervisor of the guild is called the Guild Leader.  They focus on the development of guild members and ensure that the guild adheres to a processes aligned with OSIsoft Engineering.  Each guild also has one or more members in contributor roles. Some of these roles have different levels of expertise.  As in the technical track for Software Development, the levels are important to the relationship between leaders and contributors in each guild.  A key responsibility of the Guild Leader is to help find opportunities for guild members to grow and demonstrate their skills in order to progress in their careers.  Moving from one level to another is one way to advance your career, whether at this organization or a future job after this organization.  The levels and associated skills should be transferrable.</p>
	</br>

<h2>Level Categories</h2>
<p>There are many ways to categorize the attributes that make a guild member successful, but these four categories are particular to our organization’s software development culture. These categories represent the key areas of development and mastery at each level.</p>

<h3>Technical Skill [T]</h3>
<p>Have you been seeking to improve your craft? Have you become an expert and/or gained expertise in multiple technical areas?</p>
</br>
<h3>Productivity [P]</h3>
<p>How does your work align with OSIsoft’s overarching goals? How reliably and consistently have you delivered complete work items? How large and complex a feature or capability have you proven capable of owning? How efficiently do you work with other departments? How well do you understand tradeoffs between velocity and technical debt?</p>
</br>
<h3>Empathy [E]</h3>
<p>How receptive are you to outside feedback on your work? How broad of a perspective do you consider when making decisions? Can you independently identify stakeholders who will be affected by your work and proactively incorporate their viewpoints into your technical designs? To what degree do you prioritize the team’s needs over your own?</p>
</br>
<h3>Influence [I]</h3>
<p>How effectively have you communicated your team’s challenges, their importance, and solutions? How effectively have you been able to resolve conflicts? Have you raised the level of your team through documentation, standards, reusable work products, and best practices? Have you effectively communicated within your team and across teams? Have you developed other guild members’ skills through mentorship and developmental feedback?</p>
</br>

<h2>Level Descriptions</h2>
<p>Each role description below has two parts, a high-level description, and common attributes.
</br>
Attributes are tagged by four categories: (T) Technical Skill, (P) Productivity, (E) Empathy, and (I) Influence. As outlined in the FAQ, these attributes aren’t an exhaustive checklist but rather a guideline for behavior we would expect from someone at that level.
</p>

<h2>Deployment & Performance Guild</h2>
<p>The Deployment and Performance Guild supports the rapid deployment of OSIsoft software and services which provide quiet enjoyment to our customers by producing prescriptive deployment topologies, best practices for deploying our software and performance envelopes for these prescribed deployment topologies.</p>

<h3>Deployment & Performance Guild Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Produce prescriptive topologies for PI Systems.</li>
	<li>Produce optimized workflows for key PI System tasks.</li>
	<li>Document the performance envelope for prescribed topologies.</li>
	<li>Provide system lifecycle / TCO optimization feedback to Product Management.</li>
	<li>Contribute to the engineering body of knowledge and library of testing tools and procedures.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The guild is responsible for verification and documentation of PI System prescriptive topologies.  These topologies are the mechanism by which Engineering communicates how the products we make were designed to go together and, for a given set of hardware, what level of performance can reasonably be expected. In order to produce such a topology, the guild needs to bring together:
	<ul>
		<li>The use cases for which a product was targeted</li>
		<li>The assumptions made when a product was designed and developed</li>
		<li>Performance targets that originated from Product Management</li>
		<li>Any test results available from development teams</li>
		<li>The needs of OSIsoft support and service personnel</li>
		<li>The compute environments typical of our customers</li>
		<li>A complete understanding of the goals and tasks of PI System Administrators and power users</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>A broad skillset is required to meld such varied inputs together, and there are significant differences between the business-oriented tasks and the technical tasks required for the final output.  Members of this guild should exhibit the attributes listed for their role, but it is unlikely that any one team member will possess all skills required for the guild in abundance.</p>

<h3>Deployment & Performance Guild Roles and Career Track</h3>
<p>There are three levels within the Deployment & Performance Guild. The team hires experienced PI system experts directly and does not consider inexperienced applicants or new graduates. The levels are:
	<ul>
		<li>PI System Specialist II</li>
		<li>Senior PI System Specialist</li>
		<li>Staff PI System Specialist</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Attributes of the D&P Guild roles are cumulative.</p>

<h3>PI System Specialist II</h3>
<p>Goal is to focus on topology execution, data gathering, analysis, and reporting.  This role requires the ability to work unsupervised at times, but the tasks are most often executed in cooperation with other guild staff in the same role.  Coordination of environment changes and test execution is essential to the successful completion of work items for everyone on the team.</p>
<p>Attributes
	<ul>
		<li>Displays solid foundation in PI System administration duties. [T]</li>
		<li>Has a working knowledge of the tools used in the guild. [T]</li>
		<li>Asks for help and guidance when appropriate. [T, P, E]</li>
		<li>Rapidly refines and improves their skills based on feedback. [T, E]</li>
		<li>Follows team processes, documentation, and best practices. [T, P, E]</li>

		<li>Displays humility and a willingness to learn and ask for help. [P, E]</li>
		<li>Gives thoughtful feedback on test results. [T, I]</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Senior PI System Specialist</h3>
<p>Goal is to serve as the designers on the team.  They are responsible for the design of PI System prescriptive topologies to be tested and are also the designers of the test suite used to verify topologies.  They require a much deeper understanding of how customers use PI day-to-day than Specialist II. Prior experience in a customer facing role (or as a customer) is preferred for this role.  Additionally, Senior specialists should have some exposure to software development – especially testing – in order to be successful in the role. Because the “system architect” and “software test engineer” aspects of this role are so different, it is not expected that any given Senior Specialist possesses all attributes listed below.  Team members with different combinations of these attributes can be successful in this role.</p>
<p>Attributes
	<ul>
		<li>Demonstrates abundant understanding of and ability to perform the duties of an Enterprise PI System administrator [T,E]</li>
		<li>Demonstrates a high level of skill in the tools used by the guild to build and execute topology tests. [T]</li>

		<li>Identifies areas for improvement at team level in technical systems or processes and follows through until issue is acknowledged. [P, E]</li>
		<li>Leads a few, small scale, small impact initiatives with independent follow through to resolutions. [T, P]</li>
		<li>Seeks exposure beyond team. [T]</li>
		<li>Communicates efficiently and effectively within team, and department. [I]</li>
		<li>Takes an active role in recruiting new team members. [E, I]</li>
	</ul>
</p>

The Staff Specialist works closely with the Architecture group and with IT to ensure that the test infrastructure and the automated tests are implemented in an efficient, scalable manner, consistent with other OSIsoft development work.  The Staff Specialist also has significant input to the topology design process, being responsible for the “what was it designed to do” aspects that the guild must consider.  This makes the Staff Specialist the primary liaison between the guild and the other technical staff in OSIsoft engineering.</p>
<p>Attributes
	<ul>
		<li>Demonstrates knowledge requisite to owning and managing a production PI System of high-complexity and/or scope. [T, I, P]</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Operations Guild</h2>

<p>The Operations Guild is responsible for the tools and systems used within Engineering to execute our processes to support our objectives. Guided by a DevOps philosophy, the Operations Guild will take an approach to technology management that stresses communication, collaboration, integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and our IT and Customer Support operational (“ops”) personnel. This serves the purpose of creating and delivering software applications and services to our users. </p>
<p>While this guild may be branded as the "DevOps Team", it’s misguided to think that DevOps is implemented by a single dedicated team. DevOps is not “the team that handles DevOps for us,” but rather “a team that behaves according to DevOps principals.” Our team aims to operate in a sufficiently cross-functional way to provide all the disciplines of development, testing, operations, etc. that are needed in a development workflow.</p>
<p>A principle focus is to create units of automation so that the developers can deploy code to development, test, staging, and production environments on their own. We facilitate a safe and managed connection between developers and application (service) users. We are trying to arrange things so that Ops itself “gets out of the way” while maintaining a managed and controlled framework of activity.</p>

<h3>Operations Guild Responsibilities</h3>
<br>

<h4>Enable Automated Environment Creation</h4>
<p>This a crucial capability for reliably creating consistent environments. There are two key requirements: 
	<ul>
		<li>Automation: A variety of authorized roles within OSIsoft are enabled to start environments on-demand, without involving any human beings.</li>
		<li>Consistency: Environments that are spun up accurately reflect the final production environment.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Development and Test Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Core to the guild's responsibility is infrastructure support, whether that infrastructure enables developers, testing efforts, or production users. The different phases of any application lifecycle get much more tightly integrated. Achieving this will leverage source code repositories (Git), dashboards (windows into operating environments), and testing tools (automation assisted testing workflows).</p> 

<h4>End-User Experience Monitoring</h4>
<p>This is most important and often overlooked. The guild’s aim is to have the organization monitor end user experience, not just basic performance metrics. This means stepping up beyond processing, network, and disk performance for example, and instead confirming application and services operational accessibility and performance. </p> 

<h4>Plan for Failure</h4>
<p>The guild seeks to create an enironment where we can fail quickly and fix just as quickly. The role of the Ops Guild is not to slow things down to avoid the problem, but rather to hit the problem hard and fast, enabling a culture where it is accepted that failure will occur. When the Operations Guild is fulfilling its objectives, a buggy release shouldn't mean rolling back to the last version, but rather releasing another one quickly. </p> 

<h4>Other Responsibilities</h4>
<p>
	<ul>

		<li>Work cross-functionally with developer, program manager, and architecture teams to improve our developer platforms in support of OSIsoft critical programs and projects.</li>
		<li>Build solutions to problems that interrupt availability, performance, and stability in our systems, services, and products. </li>
		<li>Perform a wide variety of technical and administrative duties in overall system design, development, and delivery. </li>
		<li>Develop, improve, and document operational practices and procedures to further champion a DevOps mindset.</li>
		<li>Support the automated lifecycle of Production, Staging/QA, and Development environments as needed in both on-premise and cloud environments.</li>
		<li>Provide the necessary infrastructure to maintain multiple dev/test environments, ensuring each environment is consistently set up, configured, and available for each release as scheduled. </li>
		<li>Design and assist in the architecture, maintenance, and support of build/release CI/CD.</li>
		<li>Trace complex build problems, release issues, and environmental issues.</li>
		<li>Research and test new technology capabilities and platforms; work to integrate them into existing solutions to drive improved productivity.</li>
		<li>Author and maintain scripting tools that reliably manage cloud applications & data pipelines.</li>
		<li>Write scripts, deployment frameworks, tracers, monitors, self-healing/auto remediation tools to mitigate downtime and manual support activities.</li>
	</ul>
