	<h1>Leadership Career Track</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>People leaders focus on the health and performance of a team and the individuals within the team. The output of the team is their responsibility. A healthy team has engaged, empowered, and motivated employees. People leaders encourage development, have honest conversations about performance, and have a dedication to quality work. We look to people leaders to have a long-term perspective and help manage through change within the organization. They are relationship builders within their team and beyond. Leaders are more visible stewards of company culture, values and attitudes. This includes keeping the good of the customer front of mind. Leaders are dedicated to honesty, integrity, and creating an environment of inclusion and value. Their level of transparency and clear communication inspire trust and understanding. The skills for leaders remain the same at each level of leadership, but they should become more and more proficient with them as they progress along the management track. </p>
	</br>
  <h2>Leadership Roles</h2>
  <p>There are different roles and levels within the guild track: 
  <ul>
  <li>Engineering Manager</li>
  <li>Engineering Program Manager</li>
  <li>Director of Engineering Program Management</li>
  <li>Engineering Department Lead</li>
  <li>Director of Engineering Department Leadership</li>
</ul>
  </p>
	</br>

<h2>Level Descriptions</h2>
<p>Each description has three parts: a high-level description, specific things that they do in the role, and skills that people express. The skills expressed in people leadership are similar across levels, so we will list them once with the understanding that they are exercised with more proficiency at higher levels.</p>
</br>

They have a high level of focus on the skill growth of their team and modeling and instilling an attitude and perspective that is aligned with OSIsoft. They are the primary resource for process questions and can answer questions about work content as well. They are focused mostly on daily and weekly execution through standard processes. They help the team focus and execute against their goals. They keep the energy and standards high. Their decisions impact their immediate team and work product. </p>

<h2>Engineering Program Manager</h2>
<p>The Engineering Program Manager’s main objective is to collaborate with product management and architecture to drive a specific program to completion by coordinating that program’s needs across the program’s engineering teams. While the product management team represents the customer needs and requirements (the “why”), and the architecture team provides the technical guidance (the “what”), the engineering program management team focuses on the processes and procedures across the engaged engineering teams (the “how”). Specific duties of an Engineering Program Manager may include:

<ul>
<li>Identify the skills required of the engineering teams necessary to execute the program.  </li>
<li>Understand and communicate to engineering the goals of the program, especially to the teams involved in the program.  </li>
<li>Schedule and conduct sprint reviews for the program.  </li>
<li>Establish procedures for collecting and organizing the program’s artifacts (i.e. meeting recordings).  </li>
<li>Ensure consistency of procedures across the teams engaged in the program (i.e. consistent use of work items).  </li>
<li>Coordinate with other programs (i.e. prioritize disruptions to the program).</li>
<li>Manage any program pre-releases (i.e. Private Preview).  </li>
<li>Collaborate with Customer Service to ensure proper support for the program.  </li>
<li>Represent the program at and coordinate its contribution to quarterly reviews.  </li>
<li>Report on the program to the Director of Engineering Program Management.  </li>
<li>Schedule and conduct coordination meetings between Engineering Managers for the teams involved in the program.  </li>
<li>Coordinate the program’s representation at regional seminars and users conferences (PI World).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Ideally the Engineering Program Manager has experience as a Senior Software Developer and Engineering Manager. Future career path could include Director of Engineering Program Management, Engineering Department Lead, Director of Engineering Department Leadership, and Vice President of Engineering. The Engineering Program Manager reports to the Director of Engineering Program Management.
