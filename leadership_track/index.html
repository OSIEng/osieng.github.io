title: Leadership Track - OSIsoft Engineering
---

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Leadership Career Track</h1>
	<p>People leaders focus on the health and performance of a team and the individuals within the team. The output of the team is their responsibility. A healthy team has engaged, empowered, and motivated employees. People leaders encourage development, have honest conversations about performance, and have a dedication to quality work. We look to people leaders to have a long-term perspective and help manage through change within the organization. They are relationship builders within their team and beyond. Leaders are more visible stewards of company culture, values and attitudes. This includes keeping the good of the customer front of mind. Leaders are dedicated to honesty, integrity, and creating an environment of inclusion and value. Their level of transparency and clear communication inspire trust and understanding. Some of the skills for leaders remain the same at each level of leadership, but a leader should become more and more proficient with these as they progress along the management track. </p>
	</br>
  <h2>Leadership Roles</h2>
  <p>There are different roles and levels within the leadership track:
