title: OCS Operations Overview - OSIsoft Engineering
---
<div class="blurb">

    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>There are three groups -- Operations Guild, Infrastructure Development Teams, and Feature Development Teams -- that build and maintain OSIsoft Cloud Services. This platform consists of the Service Fabric, Azure resources, and the supporting core services and libraries. Responsibilities are split across the three groups as follows. The Operations Guild helps automate DevOps tooling, manage Azure resources, and controls access to the cluster. Infrastructure teams develop core services, frameworks, and libraries to support the platform and microservices. Development teams maintain the health and performance of the services they are responsible for. The Engineering Department Leads maintain the assignments of teams to services/codebases.</p>
    <p>An informal group identified as the Service Operations Experts Team (formerly the Service Operations Core Group), consisting of five or six individuals from Operations, Infrastructure, and Feature teams, form a committee dedicated to operating OCS. They identify and support efforts to assure and maintain stable cluster operations and coordinate with Architecture and Program to assure efforts requiring development teams happen in a coordinated and timely manner.</p>
    
    <h1>Operations Guild</h1>
    <p>The Operations Guild's primary role is responsibility over the tools and systems that Engineering needs to perform its function. The Guild is also responsible for operation of Azure resources used for development and as the platform for OCS. The list below cites some specific platforms and technologies that it includes.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Azure DevOps
            <ul>
                <li>Platform administration</li>
                <li>Project migration and consolidation</li>
                <li>Ongoing improvement, support, and training</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Containers and Orchestration
            <ul>
                <li>Orchestration - (Kubernetes &amp; Fabric), Cluster/Virtual Machine/Node, and Containers</li>
                <li>Containers – Docker</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pipelines
            <ul>
                <li>Pipeline Alignment – Build / Push / Deploy</li>
                Note that pipeline responsibilities are shared between operations and development teams. Operations is responsible for identifying and enforcing use of best practices. Development teams are responsible for implementing and maintaining pipelines supporting development and deployment of individual services. Further it is incumbent upon development teams to comply with best practices as identified by Operations.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Development Environments – the cloud resources shared across development teams
            <ul>
                <li>Improved isolation and auditing</li>
                Operations is responsible for identifying issues and supporting resolution of those issues. Frequently this will require the support of development teams. For example, Operations identified sharing the Integration Cluster identity database in read-only mode as a problem. Operations will notify the team with codebase responsibility, and that team should provide a resolution in a reasonable time.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Platform Maintenance
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Lifetime Artifacts (rolling certificates, keys, …)</li>
                <li>Platform Upgrades (Service Fabric runtime, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cloud Platform Governance
            <ul>
                <li>Access Control (Azure SF subscription and cluster admin, certificates, LastPass, etc.)</li>
                <li>Privileged Identity Management (PIM) configuration and management</li>
                <li>"Best Practices" on containerization and resources, e.g. dev workflow, naming conventions, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>OCS Cluster Governance
            <ul>
                <li>Access Control (OCS cluster operator, support, admin...)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Incident Response (Platform Health and Tooling Validation)
            <ul>
                <li>Periodically restore entire OCS cluster to ensure backups are valid.</li>
                <li>Ensure Azure Security Center recommendations are being followed.</li>
                <li>Incident Response Responsibilities, e.g. Azure DevOps, OCS Core platform resources.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Infrastructure Teams</h1>
    <p>Infrastructure teams are responsible for development and operation of core technologies, ensuring best practices of the infrastructure supporting the cloud and on-premises. Where the Operations Guild is responsible for Azure resources, Infrastructure Teams are responsible for OSIsoft software identified as core to cloud operations. Infrastructure teams are responsible for ensuring core technologies (identity, provisioning, secrets, logging, telemetry) that program teams can use, regardless of feature or component. Examples include the strategies for and libraries and services supporting logging and telemetry. All cloud development teams are responsible for using current versions of those libraries and following the strategies. Another example is the use of limited lifetime artifacts. Infrastructure develops the strategy for consuming the artifacts and any supporting source, all cloud development teams follow the strategy, and Operations supports rolling those secrets.</p>
    <p>Infrastructure teams are also responsible for a collection of services assigned to individual Infrastructure teams by the Engineering Department Leads.</p>
    
    <h1>Feature Development Teams</h1>
    <p>Feature Development Teams are responsible for the operation and health of services and pages they deploy to any environment of OSIsoft Cloud Services (production, staging, …). They consume frameworks and libraries from the Infrastructure teams, and they use tooling from the Operations Guild. The services for which they are responsible are assigned by the Engineering Department Leads or implied based on their current Program assignments.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Service Performance and Heath Monitoring
            <ul>
                <li>Alerts</li>
                <li>Ensure Service Health</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Incidence Response (Platform Health and Tooling Validation)
            <ul>
                <li>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity ownership relative to the services they maintain.</li>
                <li>Beyond monitoring, dev teams are expected to push “hotfix” releases to resolve performance or other operational issues.</li>
                <li>Troubleshooting when service specific issues arise, e.g., be stewards of alerts and notifications coupled to their services.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
