	<h1>Technical Career Track</h1>
	<p>This technical career track defines what we value as a software development culture at OSIsoft. The document describes the 
		opportunities for technical growth in terms of levels, and while levels are important, they do not define the way we 
		relate to each other in Software Development. For example, a Staff Software Developer is not by definition more “correct” 
		when discussing technical design with a Software Developer 2. The Senior Software Developer, by virtue of having earned 
		that level, will typically bring more experience and perspective to a discussion, but all voices have equal merit. In 
		fact, a Staff Software Developer should be adept at bringing in perspectives from other developers and helping guide 
		discussions. </p>
	<p>The levels are important to the relationship between leaders and technical contributors at this organization. A key 
		responsibility of a leader is to help find opportunities for developers to grow and demonstrate their skills in order to 
		progress their careers. Moving from one level to another is a way to advance your career, whether at this organization or 
		a future job after this organization. The levels and associated skills should be transferable.</p>

<h1>Leadership Career Track</h1>
	<p>People leaders focus on the health and performance of a team and the individuals within the team. The output of the team is their responsibility. A healthy team has engaged, empowered, and motivated employees. People leaders encourage development, have honest conversations about performance, and have a dedication to quality work. We look to people leaders to have a long-term perspective and help manage through change within the organization. They are relationship builders within their team and beyond. Leaders are more visible stewards of company culture, values and attitudes. This includes keeping the good of the customer front of mind. Leaders are dedicated to honesty, integrity, and creating an environment of inclusion and value. Their level of transparency and clear communication inspire trust and understanding. The skills for leaders remain the same at each level of leadership, but they should become more and more proficient with them as they progress along the management track. </p>
	</br>
</br>
<h1>Leadership Roles</h1>
<p>There are different roles and levels within the guild track.</p>
<h2>Level Descriptions</h2>
<p>Each description has three parts: a high-level description, specific things that they do in the role, and skills that people express. The skills expressed in people leadership are similar across levels, so we will list them once with the understanding that they are exercised with more proficiency at higher levels.</p>
<p>All people lead roles will have to exercise the following skills:
	<ul>
		<li>Inspiring and Motivating Others </li> 
		<li>Exhibits high integrity and honesty </li>
		<li>Solves problems, and analyzes issues </li>
		<li>Communicates clearly and well  </li>
		<li>Collaborates and promotes teamwork </li>
