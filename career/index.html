	<h1>Technical Career Track</h1>
	<p>This technical career track defines what we value as a software development culture at OSIsoft. The document describes the 
		opportunities for technical growth in terms of levels, and while levels are important, they do not define the way we 
		relate to each other in Software Development. For example, a Staff Software Developer is not by definition more “correct” 
		when discussing technical design with a Software Developer 2. The Senior Software Developer, by virtue of having earned 
		that level, will typically bring more experience and perspective to a discussion, but all voices have equal merit. In 
		fact, a Staff Software Developer should be adept at bringing in perspectives from other developers and helping guide 
		discussions. </p>
	<p>The levels are important to the relationship between leaders and technical contributors at this organization. A key 
		responsibility of a leader is to help find opportunities for developers to grow and demonstrate their skills in order to 
		progress their careers. Moving from one level to another is a way to advance your career, whether at this organization or 
		a future job after this organization. The levels and associated skills should be transferable.</p>
