<h2>Level Categories</h2>
<p>There are many ways to categorize the attributes that make an employee successful, but these four categories are particular to our organization’s software development culture. These categories represent the key areas of development and mastery of the different career paths at each level. These four categories are related to the company's eight competencies as shown below in italics. You can read more about these competencies on the <a href="https://osisoft1980-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/r/personal/dveenema_osisoft_com/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3FA474FD-3441-47ED-8E81-B9A8CB5C9A14%7D&file=Job%20Profiles&action=default&RootFolder=%2fpersonal%2fdveenema_osisoft_com%2fDocuments%2fJob%20Profiles">Career Planning page</a> in HR Studio.
