<h2>Create Themes (Milestones)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Each Theme represents a delivery or milestone.</li>
	<li>Most milestones should be sufficiently featureful, stable, and complete to potentially ship and market.</li>
	<li>The title of themes should be in the format "M#: Description [Release Type](optional)", e.g. "M5: UoM Support [GA]" where:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>M#: The milestone number</li>
		<li>Description: A short, human-readable description of the theme/milestone</li>
		<li>Release Type: Optional suffix, enclosed by square brackets, to indicate the type of release.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>UIT: User Integration Testing</li>
			<li>Lighthouse: Lighthouse Release</li>
			<li>GA: General Availability</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

	<li>Target Completion Date</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The target completion date / milestone of this release theme is: &lt;Estimated Month Year&gt; and/or &lt;Milestone like PI World&gt;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Theme Template<br>
		<img src="/images/ThemeTemplate.PNG" style="width:100%">
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Epics</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Epics are potentially shippable/deployable (i.e. tested, documented, and complete) deliverables that define the Program.</li>
	<li>With technical guidance, develop a collection of Epics.</li>
	<li>An Epic should encompass a cohesive, coherent deliverable such that it can be moved easily between milestones, accounting for significant dependencies.</li>
	<li>Infrastructure (Technically-Driven) Epics should be avoided.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Epics should be user- and persona-driven.</li>
		<li>Non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, scale, security, usability, maintainability), technical work (e.g. integration testing, package upgrades, refactoring, environment setup, CI/CD pipelines) and documentation (e.g. user guide and release documentation) should be incorporated into epics that they enable.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>UI Epics should be avoided unless backend and UI work realistically provides independent value.</li>
</ul>

	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Schedule the Epics into Themes</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Core functionality can be delivered before extended functionality.</li>
	<li>Description: “At the end of this Theme, the customer will be able to….”</li>
	<li>Epics represent a demonstrable piece of functionality (e.g. vertical slice of a system) that is potentially shippable. In contrast, Themes represent an aggregate of Epics that satisfy a specific market scenario. When Themes are complete, they can be showcased during a Lighthouse engagement or released to a customer.</li>
	<li>These aggregations will change as the Program matures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Features under Each Epic</h2>

<p>Features mark the hand off from the Program team to the Development team. The Technical Product Manager (TPM), Engineering Manager (EM), and Staff Developer collaborate to break down Epics into Features.</p>
<p>Features are created and remain in the product backlog, if an appropriate product backlog exists; otherwise they can remain in the program backlog.</p>

	</ul>
	<li>Timeline Driver</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Define when the feature needs to be complete, for example, PI World SF 2020, and the reasoning for the timeline date. The target date should be used with this to indicate the expected Feature completion date.</li>

<h2>Backlog Items (actual dev work)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Features are often implemented by a single development team.</li>
	<li>The development team authors Backlog Items from Features, with assistance from TPM as necessary.</li>
