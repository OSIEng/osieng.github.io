  <p>The Engineering department holds All-hands meetings on a regular basis to ensure that we are operating in a transparent fashion and that everyone in the department has access to all of the latest news and information about our organization and our progress towards goals.</p>
  <p>Questions, concerns and suggestions related to topics discussed in these meetings is strongly encouraged and can be shared via one of the Teams channels mentioned at the conclusion of each meeting.</p>
  <p>As needed, we will also make use of survey tools, such as Microsoft Forms, to poll the department and ensure weâ€™re communicating effectively.</p>
