	<h1>OSIsoft Engineering Culture and Organization</h1>
	<h2>An Evolving Department</h2>
	<p>As part of an agile and focused department, it is important that we frequently review what is working, what is not, 
		and what needs refinement. Below is an enumeration of how we work today, what is working, and some challenges that 
		have been observed in the department over the years.</p>
	</br>
	<h2>Current State</h2>
	<p>The engineering organization at OSIsoft has historically been one of the more stable departments with respect to hiring and 
		attrition. When we bring someone into the department, they join a team and we expect that they will stay on that team for 
		several years. Over that tenure, we expect that they will gradually learn skills and grow as the prodcut matures.</p>
	<p>At the end of 2017, we created a new Product department under Gregg Le Blanc's management. The creation of this new department 
		allowed engineering to focus on core development related activities while also contibuting to communication challenges and 
		distributed accountability for product delivery. The engineering department has effectively been split into two functional 
		groups: Product Definition and Software Development.</p>
	<p>As we enter 2018, we are on the verge of delivering major new capabilities to the PI System. These new capabilities will not 
		just incrementally add to the existing system but are planned as major new value and revenue generating components. Some 
		of these capabilities will be delivered as SaaS offerings, some as Enterprise software components, and some as OEM 
		offerings at the edge.</p>
	</br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<h3>Expanded Portfolio</h3>
<p>Along with new delivery patterns come new development, operations, and support challenges. All these factors represent a significant 
	delta to the role of a developer at OSIsoft.</p>
</br>
<h3>Portfolio Agility</h3>
<p>As technology evolves, markets change and our products have to mature. As products mature, we need to rebalance our priorities so that 
	we are making smart investments. Instead of slowing down, we can expect the rate of change to increase and we need to be ready to 
	respond effectively.</p>
</br>
<h3>Team Silos</h3>
<p>This growth process can be somewhat haphazard and sometimes frustrating for the individual and the manager. Throughout the engineering 
	department, onboarding processes are also unique to each team and prone to atrophy if the team isn't in a growth phase. Similar 
	to onboarding, development tooling and processes vary wildly between teams. In some cases, this is understandable and deliberate 
	where we have products written in different languages or targeting different primary personas. In most cases, however, these 
	differences arise from a lack of oversight and a focus on consistency. This makes it increasingly difficult for individuals to 
	move between teams and feel productive. We've heard that, in extreme cases, moving between teams is akin to joining a new 
	company.</p>
</br>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>It can sometimes be difficult to understand who makes a decision or how that decision has been made. In some cases, it's even 
	difficult to ascertain that a deliberate decision has been made at all.</p>
</br>
<h2>Opportunity for Improvement</h2>
<h3>Professional Development</h3>
<p>The engineering department needs to develop and deliver the very best products and services. To accomplish this, we need to continue 
	to attract and retain the best talent. This increasingly means creating more opportunities for growth within the department. 
	This doesn't necessarily mean creating titles or hierarchy but rather creating opportunities to learn new skills and taking on 
	roles with well-ascribed responsbilities.</p>
<p>We want employees to feel empowered to make deicisons and equally confident that they are making decisions commensurate to their 
	level of perspective. We want to support highly autonomous and creative teams. At the same time, we also want to reuse 
	technology and focus on solving new problems.</p>
<p>Some roles will unavoidably become more specialized as a necessary side effect of scaling the department. As we create boundaries, 
	it is important that we focus on communication, so individuals or groups don't become isolated and disenfranchised. As we 
	redefine roles and career tracks, it is important that we communicate broadly any responsbilities and opportunities that arise.</p>
