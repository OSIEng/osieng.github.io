	<h1>OSIsoft Engineering Culture and Organization</h1>
	<h1>An Evolving Department</h1>
	<p>As part of an agile and focused department, it’s important that we frequently review what’s working, what’s not, and what needs refinement. The following list enumerates some of challenges that have been observed in the department and how we work today. There is plenty that is working currently too, but we’ll start by looking at the gaps. </p>
	</br>
	<h2>Product</h2>
	<p>At the end of last year, 2017, we created a new Product department reporting to Gregg Le Blanc. This new department essentially extracted the role of defining the product roadmap from the traditional engineering organization. The creation of this new department allowed engineering to focus on core development related activities but also created communication challenges and distributed accountability for product delivery. The engineering organization has effectively been split into two functional groups Product Definition and Software Development.  </p>
<h2>Expanded Portfolio</h2>	
<p>As we enter 2018 we are on the verge of delivering major new capabilities to the PI System. These new capabilities will not just incrementally add to the existing system but are planned as major new value and revenue generating components. Some of these capabilities will be delivered as SaaS offerings, some as Enterprise software components and some as OEM offerings at the edge. Along with new delivery patterns, come new development, operations and support challenges. All these factors represent a significant delta to the role of a developer at OSIsoft. </p>
<h2>Portfolio Agility</h2>	
<p>As we continue to grow it is important to consider how to maintain our agility. As technology evolves, markets change, and products mature we need to rebalance our priorities, so we are making smart investments. Instead of slowing down, we can expect the rate of change to increase and we need to be ready to respond effectively.  </p>
	</br>

<h2>Team Silos</h2>
<p>The engineering organization at OSIsoft has historically been one of the more stable departments with respect to hiring and attrition. When we bring someone into the department, they join a team and we expect that they will stay on that team for several years. Over that tenure we expect that they will gradually learn skills and grow as the product matures. We have observed that this growth process can be somewhat haphazard and sometimes frustrating for the individual and the manager. Throughout the engineering department, onboarding processes are also unique to each team and prone to atrophy if the team isn’t in a growth phase. </p>
</br>
<p>As with onboarding, development tooling and processes vary wildly between teams. In some cases, this is understandable and deliberate where we have products written in different languages or targeting different primary personas. In most cases, however, these differences arise from a lack of oversight and a focus on consistency. This makes it increasingly difficult for individuals to move between teams and feel productive. We’ve heard that in extreme cases, moving between teams is akin to joining a new company. </p>
</br>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>Another challenge with growth is creating an atmosphere of transparency. It can sometimes be difficult to understand who or how a decision has been made and in some cases it’s even difficult to ascertain that a deliberate decision has been made at all. We want employees to feel empowered to make decisions and equally, we want them to feel confident that they are making decisions commensurate to their level of perspective. We want to support highly autonomous and creative teams, but we also want to reuse technology and focus on solving on new problems. </p>
</br>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>The engineering department needs to develop and deliver the very best products and services. To accomplish this, we need to continue to attract and retain the best talent. Increasingly, this means creating more opportunities for growth within the department. This doesn’t necessarily mean creating titles or hierarchy but rather creating opportunities to learn new skills and taking on roles with well ascribed responsibilities.  </p>
</br>
<h2>Specialization</h2>
<p>Some roles will unavoidably become more specialized as a necessary side effect of scaling the department. As we create boundaries it is important that we focus on communication, so individuals or groups don’t become isolated and disenfranchised. As we redefine roles and career tracks it is important that we communicate broadly any responsibilities and opportunities that arise. </p>
