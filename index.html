	<h1>OSIsoft Engineering Organization and Culture</h1>
	<h2>An Evolving Department</h2>
	<p>As part of an agile and focused department, it is important that we frequently review what is working, what is not, 
		and what needs refinement. Below is an enumeration of how we work today, what is working, and some challenges that 
		have been observed in the department over the years.</p>
	<h2>Current State</h2>
	<p>The engineering organization at OSIsoft has historically been one of the more stable departments with respect to hiring and 
		attrition. When we bring someone into the department, they join a team and we expect that they will stay on that team for 
		several years. Over that tenure, we expect that they will gradually learn skills and grow as the prodcut matures.</p>
	</br>
	<p>At the end of 2017, we created a new Product department under Gregg Le Blanc's management. The creation of this new department 
		allowed engineering to focus on core development related activities while also contibuting to communication challenges and 
		distributed accountability for product delivery. The engineering department has effectively been split into two functional 
		groups: Product Definition and Software Development.</p>
	</br>
	<p>As we enter 2018, we are on the verge of delivering major new capabilities to the PI System. These new capabilities will not 
		just incrementally add to the existing system but are planned as major new value and revenue generating components. Some 
		of these capabilities will be delivered as SaaS offerings, some as Enterprise software components, and some as OEM 
		offerings at the edge.</p>
