	<h1>OSIsoft Engineering Culture and Organization</h1>
	<h1>An Evolving Department</h1>
	<p>As part of an agile and focused department, it’s important that we frequently review what’s working, what’s not, and what needs refinement. The following list enumerates some of challenges we have observed in our department over the years that we are seeking to address with our current organization.</p>
	</br>
	<h2>Product</h2>
	<p>At the end of 2017, we created a new Product department reporting to a Product VP. This new department essentially extracted the role of defining the product roadmap from the traditional engineering organization. The creation of this new department allowed engineering to focus on core development related activities but also created communication challenges and distributed accountability for product delivery. The engineering organization is effectively split into two functional groups: Product Definition and Software Development.  </p>
<h2>Expanded Portfolio</h2>	
<p>In 2018 we began working on major new capabilities of the PI System. These new capabilities do not just incrementally add to the existing system but are planned as major new value and revenue generating components. Some of these capabilities are being delivered as SaaS offerings, some as Enterprise software components and some as OEM offerings at the edge. Along with new delivery patterns came new development, operations and support challenges. All these factors represented a significant delta to the role of a developer at OSIsoft. </p>
<h2>Portfolio Agility</h2>	
<p>As we continue to grow it is important to consider how to maintain our agility. As technology evolves, markets change, and products mature we need to rebalance our priorities, so we are making smart investments. Instead of slowing down, we can expect the rate of change to increase and we need to be ready to respond effectively.  </p>
	</br>

<h2>Team Silos</h2>
<p>The engineering organization at OSIsoft has historically been one of the more stable departments with respect to hiring and attrition. When we bring someone into the department, they join a team and we expect that they will stay on that team for several years. Over that tenure we expect that they will gradually learn new skills and grow as the product matures. In the past, we observed that this growth process could be somewhat haphazard and sometimes frustrating for the individual and the manager. Throughout the engineering department, onboarding processes were also unique to each team and prone to atrophy if the team was not in a growth phase. </p>
</br>
<p>As with onboarding, development tooling and processes could vary wildly between teams. In some cases, this was understandable and deliberate where we had products written in different languages or targeting different primary personas. In most cases, however, these differences arose from a lack of oversight and a lack of focus on consistency. This made it increasingly difficult for individuals to move between teams and feel productive. We heard that in extreme cases, moving between teams was akin to joining a new company. </p>
</br>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>Another challenge with growth was the need to create an atmosphere of transparency. It was sometimes be difficult to understand how or by whom a decision was made and in some cases it was even difficult to ascertain that a deliberate decision had been made at all. We want employees to feel empowered to make decisions and equally, we want them to feel confident that they are making decisions commensurate to their level of perspective. We want to support highly autonomous and creative teams, but we also want to reuse technology and focus on solving on new problems. </p>
</br>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>The engineering department needs to develop and deliver the very best products and services. To accomplish this, we need to continue to attract and retain the best talent. Increasingly, this means creating more opportunities for growth within the department. This doesn’t necessarily mean creating titles or hierarchy but rather creating opportunities to learn new skills and taking on roles with well ascribed responsibilities.  </p>
</br>
<h2>Specialization</h2>
<p>Some roles unavoidably became more specialized as a necessary side effect of scaling the department. As we create boundaries it is important that we focus on communication, so individuals or groups don’t become isolated and disenfranchised. As we define roles and career tracks it is important that we communicate broadly any responsibilities and opportunities that arise. </p>
