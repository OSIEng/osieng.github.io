	<li>Engineering Managers will send Sprint Complete Email</li>
	<ul>

		<li>Send Email to: "Development Team" Engineering2@osisoft.com</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The Program Manager will post the video of the Program Sprint Review</li>

	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Program Sprint Reviews</h2>
<p>The Program Sprint Review is organized by the Program Manager but is executed by the Engineering Managers and teams. The goal of the Program Sprint Review is to <strong>demo</strong> the work completed in the sprint. The review should be structured so that the features <strong>completed</strong> in a sprint are demoed by the developers that completed the work. In the event there are no demos, the Program Manager may decide that there will be no sprint review for this period, but the Engineering Managers must still complete the sprint end tasks.</p>

<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>The demo should contain an overview of the feature, why we're building it then show how to use it from the user persona's perspective. Developers should demonstrate that they understand why we're building any particular feature. If we are demoing part of a larger feature story, the developers should explain what aspect of the larger story they are demoing.</p>

<h4>Demo Tips</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Show only done work</li>
	<li>Avoid slides where possible, use slides to add color to the demos, i.e. picture of workflow, architecture etc.</li>
	<li>Avoid the technical details, focus on the outcome</li>
	<li>Avoid "what's next" content</li>
	<li>Focus on End to End demos, not pieces and parts of a larger feature</li>
	<li>Avoid showing demos from your develoment machine, show done deployed features</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting Team Progress</h3>
<p>It is not necessary to review the teams story point completion, list of WI's completed or impediments during the sprint review. That will be reviewed during the Scrum of Scrums and Program Sprint Planning sessions.</p>
