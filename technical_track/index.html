title: Technical Track - AVEVA Operations Information R&D
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Technical Career Track</h1>
	<p>This technical career track defines what we value as a software development culture in AVEVA Operations Information R&D. The document describes the 
		opportunities for technical growth in terms of levels, and while levels are important, they do not define the way we 
		relate to each other in Software Development. For example, a Principal Technologist is not by definition more “correct” 
		when discussing technical design with a Member of Technical Staff - II. The Senior Member of Technical Staff, by virtue of having earned 
		that level, will typically bring more experience and perspective to a discussion, but all voices have equal merit. In 
		fact, a Principal Technologist should be adept at bringing in perspectives from other developers and helping guide 
		discussions. </p>
	<p>The levels are important to the relationship between leaders and technical contributors at this organization. A key 
		responsibility of a leader is to help find opportunities for developers to grow and demonstrate their skills in order to 
		progress their careers. Moving from one level to another is a way to advance your career, whether at this organization or 
		a future job after this organization. The levels and associated skills should be transferable.</p>
	</br>

<h2>Technical Levels</h2>
<p>There are six roles within the technical career path, from Member of Technical Staff to Distinguished Technologist: 
<ul>
	<li>Member of Technical Staff</li> 
	<li>Member of Technical Staff - II</li>
	<li>Senior Member of Technical Staff</li>
	<li>Principal Technologist</li>
	<li>Partner Technologist</li>
	<li>Distinguished Technologist</li>
</ul>
</p>
</br>
<h2>Level Categories</h2>
<p>There are many ways to categorize the attributes that make a developer successful, but these four categories are particular to our organization’s software development culture. These categories represent the key areas of development and mastery of software development at each level.</p>

<h3>Technical Skill [T]</h3>
<p>Have you been seeking to improve your craft? Have you become an expert and/or gained expertise in multiple technical areas? </p>
</br>
<h3>Productivity [P]</h3>
<p>How does your work align with the overarching goals of AVEVA Operations Information R&D? How reliably and consistently have you delivered complete work items? How large and complex a feature or capability have you proven capable of owning? How efficiently do you work with other departments? How well do you understand tradeoffs between velocity and technical debt? </p>
</br>
<h3>Empathy [E]</h3>
<p>How receptive are you to outside feedback on your work? How broad of a perspective do you consider when making decisions? Can you independently identify stakeholders who will be affected by your work and proactively incorporate their viewpoints into your technical designs? To what degree do you prioritize the team’s needs over your own? </p>
</br>
<h3>Influence [I]</h3>
<p>How effectively have you communicated your team’s challenges, their importance, and solutions? How effectively have you been able to resolve conflicts? Have you raised the level of your team through design documents, coding standards, reusable components, and best practices? Have you effectively communicated within your team and across teams? Have you developed other developers’ skills through mentorship, code review, and technical feedback? </p>
</br>

<h2>Level Descriptions</h2>
<p>Each description has two parts, a high-level description, and common attributes. 
</br>
Attributes are tagged by four categories: (T) Technical Skill, (P) Productivity, (E) Empathy, and (I) Influence. As outlined in the FAQ, these attributes aren’t an exhaustive checklist but rather a guideline for behavior we would expect from someone at that level. The attributes listed for each level are also cumulative.  Individuals are expected to exhibit attributes of all levels up to and including their current role.

<h2>Career Timeline</h2>
<p>It is a common question for developers to wonder how long it takes before they are ready for the level above their current one. The following section provides a framework for reasoning about the progression of a contributor through the levels defined in the technical career track. Assuming a developer is on a path of constant progression and growth, a model career timeline should roughly look like the following: 
	<ul>
		<li>Member of Technical Staff to Member of Technical Staff - II: ~1 year </li>
		<li>Member of Technical Staff - II to Senior Member of Technical Staff: ~2-3 years </li>
		<li>Senior Member of Technical Staff to Principal Technologist: ~3+ years </li>
		<li>Principal Technologist to Partner Technologist: ~4+ years </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The timeline is more rigid at the lower levels than at the higher ones:</p>
<p>From Member of Technical Staff to Senior Member of Technical Staff, the goal is first to become a fully independent individual contributor and then to gain the ability to execute projects with minimal support and guidance; this is a progression that should be natural and achievable by all developers at this organization. </p>
<p>At the higher levels (Senior Member of Technical Staff and above), the timeline becomes open-ended: those levels recognize the development of a sense of initiative and identifying opportunities that will have a high impact. This might require a significant amount of time and effort to demonstrate. For some developers, this leap may not happen; many developers will not progress beyond the level of Senior Software Developer and this should not be interpreted as a negative. </p>
<p>Here are the principles that underpin the timeline presented above:
	<ul>
		<li>Time alone is not a sufficient condition for progressing through the levels of the ladder. </li>
		<li>Every promotion from one level to the next is a recognition that a developer has already been solidly operating at the higher level. </li>
		<li>Each transition takes longer than the previous one because of the increasing scope and impact of the work, which are not linear either. A strong developer will have to demonstrate sustained performance over longer periods of time to achieve a promotion to the next level. </li>
		<li>Finally, this guideline is a rule of thumb and, as all rules do, it has exceptions. We sometimes need to honor exceptional performance and achievements by tracking a developer through the ladder on a faster timeline than the one presented above. </li>
	</ul>
