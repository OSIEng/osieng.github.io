<h1>From Program to Task</h1>

<h2>Program to Task Workflow</h2>

<p>There are several steps taken the from the inception of a program to get to task creation. The diagram below illustrates the workflow for these steps.</p>

<h3>Step Descriptions</h3>

<ol>
	<li>The creation of a program begins with the SVP, Information Management (Product) collaborating with others on a new idea.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The Strategic Program Manager(SPM) authors a program brief, capturing program objectives and background.</li>
		<li>Next the Software Development Leadership Team (SDLT) reviews the program brief.</li>
		<li>Finally, the Business Unit Leadership Team (BLT) reviews the program brief.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Once the new program is approved, a program team is assigned which includes a Strategic Product Manager(SPM), Engineering Program Manager(EPM), and an Principal Software Developer(PSD). This team is responsible for driving a program to a successful completion.</li>
	<li>Development teams are assigned next. They are responsible implementing the program deliverables.</li>
	<li>In the <a href="/program_discovery_process">discovery phase</a>, the technical leads (e.g. Principal Software Developer(PSD) and Staff Developers) collaborate to perform research and analysis. During discovery, a program design document is produced and presented to the Business Unit Leadership Team(BLT).</li>
	<li>At the end of discovery, the program team (SPM, EPM and PSD) work together to define themes and epics.</li>
	<li>The Engineering Manager, Staff Developer and Technical Product Manager decompose epics into features with feedback from the program team.</li>
	<li>The development team along with the TPM create product backlog items from the features.</li>
	<li>Once Product Backlog Items(PBIs) are created in the backlog, the TPM, Engineering Manager, and Staff Developer are responsible to drive the following tasks:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Approve Backlog Items</li>
		<li>Estimation of work by development teams</li>
		<li>Prioritize Work Items</li>
	</ul>
	<li>During the sprint, the development team:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Commits to PBIs</li>
		<li>Creates and estimates tasks</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Program Phases</h3>

<p>This diagram illustrates the different phases that make up a program and the roles or groups who are responsible, contribute, review or just need to be informed.</p>
