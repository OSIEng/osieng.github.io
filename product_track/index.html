<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Product Career Track</h1>
	
	<h2>Product Management - Family</h2>
	<p>What we do all day – Focus on what we build. Not how we build it.
	</br>The OSIsoft Product Group is a partner with Development, Architecture, Sales, and Marketing. We help represent the voice of the user, customer, and the market and prioritize them into the software capabilities we deliver as products or services. This involves working across many organizational groups and prioritizing feedback. That feedback starts with empathy – identifying the specific use cases and scenarios we hear, and then translating that into sympathy – addressing a wide range of use cases and prioritizing them into actionable work that helps OSIsoft build reliable, supportable software.
	</br>At OSIsoft, we have many areas of responsibility (this won’t be exhaustive) when delivering products to market. You can divide the work up like this:
	</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Development</th>
    <th>Architecture</th>
    <th>Product</th>
    <th>Marketing</th>
    <th>Sales</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Applies resources to create and deliver on-prem products and software as a service</td>
    <td>Structures and designs technical implementations to help development create sustainable offerings</td>
    <td>Create Product Road map by identifying market problems from many sources (users, customers, and market forces) – create scenarios, features, and requirements to help Development prioritize effort</td>
    <td>Outbound communications, demand generation, product and service communications, market definition, research, and studies.</td>
    <td>Use supporting information from Product and Marketing (and Product Marketing) to match our buyers’ needs up with OSIsoft’s software (as built by Development!)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>The Infrastructure Approach</h3>	
	<p>Users typically speak to software companies about the outcomes they desire rather than the attributes of the software they use to enable those outcomes. Members of the Product Group take accumulated input and break down the outcome statements into key technical and usability categories to make sure we are addressing problems at an infrastructure level vs. an “application” focus. This ensures we deliver capabilities that span markets (e.g. Power Generation, Oil and Gas, etc.) and enable a variety of outcomes that suit customer needs (e.g. Energy Management, Condition Based Maintenance, etc.).
	</br>We call this <em>The Infrastructure Approach</em>, and it can be summarized like this:

	<ul>
  		<li>Characterize the scope of work and phases / milestones so that Development can apply resources and funding to development activities (i.e. a defined Program) that support the Infrastructure
  			<ul>
    				<li>Capabilities must integrate and extend the PI System, OSIsoft Cloud Services, and Edge Data Store</li>
    			</ul>
  		</li>
  
  		<li>Support Massive, Easy Deployments
  			<ul>
  				<li>Programmatic and User Interaction to drive scenarios appropriately</li>
  			</ul>
  		</li>
  
  		<li>Manageability is built-in – user experience does not reflect implementation complexity</li>
  		<li>Ease of Upgrade
  			<ul>
  				<li>No customer’s data is left behind, but software can evolve</li>
  			</ul>
  		</li>
  
  		<li>Separates the Application from the Data
  			<ul>
  				<li>Application configuration data</li>
  				<li>User configuration & “document” data</li>
  				<li>Application data</li>
  				<li>Health and status data</li>
  				<li>Topology / Deployment data</li>
  			</ul>
  		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	</br>
	<p>When these ideas are applied to user scenarios and stories, we stay true to our mission of delivering infrastructure and platform-level features that serve a wider variety of our customers. This is a core skill that the Product Group must possess and apply consistently to help OSIsoft deliver consistent and effective products to market.</p>

<h3>"No" - It's a Powerful Tool</h3>	
	<p>The Product Group is the steward of OSIsoft’s Product Roadmap and Product Vision. Using our skills, The Infrastructure Approach, and the data we gather about markets, users, and software trends, we help OSIsoft deliver on its mission and goals. We make decisions around prioritization in the real world, where OSIsoft has realistic capabilities as well as resource constraints.
	</br>Approving work, new features, and prioritization is a balancing act which accounts for many factors. Those factors do change over time. Therefore, saying yes – even to a seemingly small thing – often has broader impact than just a single product, team, or customer.
	</br>OSIsoft currently derives revenue from a set of core industry verticals, and in reality, only 2 or 3 of those provide a bulk of that revenue. The combination of Software Reliability (support) and software licenses will change over time as we add more Software as a Service subscription offerings. However, OSIsoft’s brand name and reputation is derived from two key traits:
	<ul>
		<li>Reliable software</li>
		<li>Support services</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<p>The Product Group’s mission is to focus on prioritizing work that leads to more reliable software and the capability to sensibly scale our support services. Customers renew their SRP contracts because of our excellent support (not necessarily new product features – “time to adoption” of new features varies widely). It’s critical to understand these aspects of our mission so that we maintain a profitable market stance and gather more happy customers.</p>


<h2>Product Careers - Product Management Levels</h2>
	<p>There are a few main Product Management job functions required to enable OSIsoft to build software and bring it to market. </p>
	</br>
<h3>Strategic Product Managers</h3>
	<p>To coordinate larger efforts across several teams to help solve market problems, Strategic Product Managers work with Program Managers to develop scenarios and work items that help create new market-facing offerings.
	</br>These collaborative patterns help translate the Product group’s long and short-term product vision and roadmap into OSIsoft’s software delivery plan and assist other groups in developing messaging around the market facing components of OSIsoft’s software stack. They communicate initial ideas and document the longer term product vision using a Product Brief and Product Requirements Document
	</br>It should be noted that Product Managers and Strategic Product Managers perform different, related functions. Strategic Product Managers do not do People Management functions (i.e. TPM’s do not report to SPM’s). These roles are expected to coordinate and communicate to bring large scenarios to market.
	</p>
</br>
<h3>Technical Product Managers</h3>
	<p>To align with individual development teams, Technical Product Managers must work closely with development Team Leads to help translate high level product priorities into work items for development team members. They function as embedded resources for development team(s) that procure and consolidate customer feedback and help communicate how the team’s work aligns with OSIsoft’s product direction. They also develop the near-term roadmap for their development team(s) and communicate requirements and success criteria using a Product Requirements Document (PRD).</p>
</br>
<h3>Pricing & Packaging Manager</h3>
	<p>Other supporting roles are also required in the Product group. These include a Pricing and Packaging Manager and internally-facing Product Management roles. The Pricing and Packaging Manager develops the actual software bundles and pricing plan with the assistance of Product Marketing Management. </p>
</br>
<h3>Internally-facing Product Management</h3>
	<p>Internal facing Product Management resources work like a regular Product Manager, except they are focused on internal resources that add to OSIsoft’s product capabilities – for instance, the OSIsoft Support Web Experience requires Product Management skills to help identify user personas and requirements which inform the structure and roll-out of the systems required to deliver the support site.</p>
</br>
<h3>Team Leads</h3>
	<p>The Product group is made up of great people with creative ideas and the skills to make them reality. To continuously cultivate the group’s capabilities, the Product group relies on Team Leads. The Team Leads will work with individuals on their career path, training, and other opportunities to keep the teams running smoothly. They have a geographical affinity (when required) to help with recruiting and to be a local resource for the teams. The Team Leads do not actually do Product Management work or influence the priority discussions that Product Managers perform in their job functions.</p>
</br>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
	<p>The lead of the entire group is the Vice President of Product. This role primarily coordinates with the Vice President of Development, and works with other leadership roles to bring together resources that will help OSIsoft strategically address market problems. This includes staffing, business alignment activities, and externally-facing / customer facing representation of OSIsoft’s product plans.</p>
</br>

<h2>Growing Careers in the Product Group</h2>
	<p>Product Management requires expertise and skill levels that can be quite varied. The growth path for the people in the Product Group relies on depth of skills and the capability to address cross-functional requirements. That means each role in the Product Group has levels associated with it, and career progress does not necessarily require assuming “people leadership” skills. Product Managers can focus on use cases that cross products as they mature or stay focused on individual development team needs.
	</br>The levels within the Product Group follow some of the established career paths elsewhere in OSIsoft. There are, so far, three levels in each Product Management role.
	</p>
</br>

<h2>Available Levels</h2>
	<p><em>Technical Product Management</em>:
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>Technical Product Manager I</li>
		<li>Technical Product Manager II</li>
		<li>Senior Technical Product Manager</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<p><em>Strategic Product Management</em>:
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>Strategic Product Manager I</li>
		<li>Strategic Product Manager II</li>
		<li>Senior Strategic Product Manager</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<p><em>Related Product Roles</em>:
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>Pricing & Packaging Manager</li>
		<li>Internally-facing Product Management (e.g. Web Resources)
			<ul>
				<li>Requires specific OSIsoft business process knowledge & PM process knowledge</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<p><em>People Leader Roles</em>:
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>Team Lead</li>
		<li>Vice President</li>
	</ul>


<h2>Leveling Up</h2>
	<p>The differentiator between the levels of mastery of each of the role’s skill sets. The actual responsibilities and functions of the role itself will not vary widely between levels.</p>
	</br>
<h3>Technical Skill [T]</h3>
	<p><em>Learning / Quality / Experience</em>
	</br>
	Have you been seeking to improve your craft? Have you developed expertise in multiple PM disciplines?
	</p>
</br>
<h3>Productivity [P]</h3>
	<p><em>Efficiency / Reliability / Scope</em>
	</br>
	How does your work align with OSIsoft’s goals and priorities? Are you delivering clear and complete work items (e.g. scenarios, user stories, personas)? How long does it take to communicate priorities and create plans that Development Teams can execute? Are developers able to directly translate your work into their backlog? Are you collaborating well between Product, Marketing, Development, and Sales? Do you understand the nuances of the company / product goals and how that impacts the user and market priority?
	</p>
</br>
<h3>Empathy [E]</h3>
	<p><em>Awareness / Perspective / Teamwork</em>
	</br>
	How receptive are you to outside feedback on your work? How well do you consider alternate perspectives? How well can you differentiate between your own opinions and motivations vs. the data gathered from users? How well do you translate individual user stories into general patterns that represent value across OSIsoft’s target market verticals? How well do you apply “The Infrastructure Approach” when translating feature requests into user stories and development priorities?
	</p>
</br>
<h3>Influence [I]</h3>
	<p><em>Communication / Mentoring / Leadership</em>
	</br>
	Are your clearly communicating the requirements from a user story to your teammates? Are you able to tie your user stories and requirements back to the overall objectives of a scenario and company goals? How well are you representing information from your stakeholders (e.g. user needs, technical requirements and blockers)? How are you at conflict resolution between various stakeholders? Can you resolve issues without calling more meetings? When you call meetings, are the requirements clear and outcomes achievable? Are you building the trust you need with your peers and stakeholders?
	</p>
